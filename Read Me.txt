Hello there,

Thanks for downloading this template.
I have tried my best to provide you a better interface. You have to visit the *Config.js* file and put your Server name Ip etc there.
You might need to Manually put the Links and images etc in HTML files so please visit each file and check that.

If you have any questions please contact me at http://justhaider.site or Message me on Discord My username : _justhaider


Thanks for choosing this template. ‚ù§
